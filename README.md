# Terraling UI

This repository is an experimental front-end for the [TerraLing project](https://terraling.com). It is a static site that uses plain JavaScript and data from a mock API to populate content.

## Installation

Since it is a static site, simply serve the directory under some port, and navigate to it. If you wish to make changes to the API, change the `API` constant in `js/constants.js`.
